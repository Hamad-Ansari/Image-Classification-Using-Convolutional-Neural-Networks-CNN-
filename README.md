# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end **image classification pipeline** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** built with **TensorFlow & Keras**.  
The goal is to accurately classify images by learning spatial features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
